----

Pipeine for Image Super-Resolution task that based on a frequently cited paper,
`ESRGAN: Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks <https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00219>`__
(Wang Xintao et al.), published in 2018.

In few words, image super-resolution (SR) techniques reconstruct a higher-resolution (HR) image or sequence
from the observed lower-resolution (LR) images, e.g. upscaling of 720p image into 1080p.

One of the common approaches to solving this task is to use deep convolutional neural networks
capable of recovering HR images from LR ones. And ESRGAN (Enhanced SRGAN) is one of them.
Key points of ESRGAN:

- SRResNet-based architecture with residual-in-residual blocks;
- Mixture of context, perceptual, and adversarial losses. Context and perceptual losses are used for proper
  image upscaling, while adversarial loss pushes neural network to the natural image manifold using a discriminator
  network that is trained to differentiate between the super-resolved images and original photo-realistic images.

Technologies
============

* `Catalyst` as pipeline runner for deep learning tasks. This new and rapidly developing `library <https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst>`__
  can significantly reduce the amount of boilerplate code. If you are familiar with the TensorFlow ecosystem,
  you can think of Catalyst as Keras for PyTorch. This framework is integrated with logging systems
  such as the well-known `TensorBoard <https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard>`__.
* `Pytorch`, `torchvision`, and `PIQ` as main frameworks for deep learning.
* `Albumentations` for data preprocessing.


Quick Start
===========

Setup environment
-----------------

`esrgan` requires python >= 3.8.

::

   pip install git+https://github.com/leverxgroup/esrgan.git

Run an experiment
-----------------

::

   # step 0 - download dir with ESRGAN experiment
   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/leverxgroup/esrgan.git

   # step 1 - supervised training of the model
   catalyst-dl run -C esrgan/experiment/config_supervised.yml --benchmark

   # step 2 - use weights from step 1 to train model using GAN approach
   catalyst-dl run -C esrgan/experiment/config_gan.yml --benchmark

where `esrgan/experiment/config.yml` is a path to the `config file <../experiment/config.yml>`__.
